# Graphical User Interface Screenshots Reference
Screenshots of various GUI or Tableau dashboards for idea generation. 

I have captured images of various applications Iâ€™ve designed and developed. Prioritizing the development of intuitive and user-friendly interfaces is essential. Maintaining these well-crafted interfaces as references is beneficial

Examples of WPF interfaces:
- [label](rebalance%20trade%20generator.md)

- [label](monthly%20index%20returns.md)
- [label](repo%20exposure.md)
- [label](stock%20loan%20rates.md)

Examples of Tableau dashboards:
