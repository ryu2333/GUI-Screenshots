# Portfolio Rebalancing Tool
The Portfolio Rebalancing Tool is designed for Portfolio Managers (PMs). It facilitates monthly adjustments of their holdings to align with the most recent allocation percentages dictated by the firm.

- The tool provides a display of the share amounts currently held by each portfolio and fund, along with detailed information on the projected rebalancing amounts, including both crossing and open market transactions.
- It incorporates firm and compliance constraints, ensuring that certain positions that are not eligible for rebalancing are managed accordingly.
- Security types are selectable by the user, allowing for tailored rebalancing strategies.
- The tool enables the crossing of positions between different funds, which can reduce costs for the firm through internal execution.
Additionally, it manages the execution of rebalancing transactions in the open market.
